Clicking that will sign you out until you sign in again.</p>
            <h2 class="pre-sub-title"><i>Reporting</i></h2>
            <p>You can report a user if he is breaking one of the rules listed inside of our terms of service. Reporting is simple. Go to the content that the user sent you; this may be a chat, a post, or a game. Then find the words ‘report user’ in bold red letters. They will face further consequences based on the rules that they broke.</p>
            <h2 class="pre-sub-title"><i>Posting</i></h2>
            <p>	Creating a post is very simple. This can be done in one of two ways. On our content page; or on your home screen. Posts can contain video/photo attachments, or just remain text in general. To respect other users, posts cannot contain sexual content nor can they harass or downgrade another user.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="margin-left: 5vw;">	Posts are age based, which also means that a user who is under 12 cannot see what a user who is older than 12 is posting. This is to protect our users from possibly malicious content that wouldn’t be appropriate for someone under 12.</p>
            <h2 class="pre-sub-title"><i>Chatting</i></h2>
            <p>We allow our users to chat with anyone of their choice for their convenience. You can chat with a user after they have accepted your friend request, or if they have private chatting open to anyone. You may report chats at any time if they break our rules and our admins will handle the situation appropriately.</p>

You will not be able to see their profile either unless you are on settings under blocked, where you will be able to unblock the user.
